Family members or others caring for a person with dementia are often subject to extreme stress. They often feel isolated, alone, and left to their own devices, dealing with the \"unknown\" and seeing their beloved ones becoming more and more distant and estranged. They may develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt, and hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow they feel for their loved one and for themselves. Depression is an extremely common consequence of being a full-time caregiver for a person with dementia. The most important thing to remember is that you cannot help someone else without helping yourself first.",

Research shows that Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) caregivers are often at increased risk for depression and illness, especially if they do not receive adequate support from family, friends and the community. If you are a caregiver, be sure you make time for sleep, exercise, proper nutrition, socialising, and private time. If you are run down, exhausted or socially isolated, you run the risk of becoming physically ill, overwhelmed and/or depressed. Do not hesitate to get outside help in time. The sooner you accept help, the longer you can be a partner to the person with dementia.\n" +

If necessary, seek mental health care from a professional who has expertise in addressing caregiver burnout, depression, and grief.\n" +
